Adds accessibility helpers to Wordpress.

== Description ==

This plugin does three things:

1. Allows you to filter the Media Library to show images that do not have alt tags set. This works in both grid and list view.
2. Prevents users from inserting images into posts that do not have alt tags.
3. Uses the Microsoft Azure Computer Vision API to fill in alt tags for previously uploaded images that do not have alt tags.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
